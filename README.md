# todo-web-jest-swc

## Reason

I decided to create this app to practice Unit Tests fundamentals. Todo App, I can tests several operations such as: create, update and remove. Then, to check if it works or not.

This time, I setup the environment test with Jest + SWC.

You can see a demo here: https://comforting-starburst-d8891b.netlify.app/

## About the project
This project was created with @vitejs/plugin-react-swc template. According to the vite's documentation, replaces Babel with SWC during development. During builds, SWC+esbuild are used when using plugins, and esbuild only otherwise. For big projects that don't require non-standard React extensions, cold start and Hot Module Replacement (HMR) can be significantly faster.
